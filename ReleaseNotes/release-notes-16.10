        Release Notes for BoxLib 16.10

The development branch was merged into master on October 3, 2016.

* New Features
** Reduce duplicated BoxArrays after restart.
** MultiFab::SumBoundary works on nodal data now.
** MultiFab::AddProduct that computes dst += src1*src2.
** Add two more initialization routines for particles.
** Add FluxRegister::ClearInternalBorders that zeros out fine/fine fluxes in FluxRegister. 
** Add FabSet::plusTo (a MultiFab)
** MultiFab::Xpay and BaseFab::xpay that do y = x + a*y
** Add MultiFab::Dot that returns the scalar dot product of two MultiFabs.
** Add MultiFab::LinComb that computes linear combination of two MultiFabs.
** New bl_fort_module Fortran module for C++.  The module contains c_real
data type matching Real in C++.

* Backward Incompatible Changes
** Remove deprecated Geometry::FillPeriodicBoundary and Geometry::PeriodicCopy

* Major Changes
** Some Nyx specific Particle functions have been moved out of BoxLib.
** Updating User's Guide
** New tutorial and cleanup of C++ tutorials.
** Simplify boundary filling process for MultiFab not in StateData.
** Some OpenMP and tiling in linear solvers.
** BaseFab Fortran functions are now dimension agnostic.
** Call various Initialize() in BoxLib::Initialize() to ensure thread safety
** C_BoundaryLib: new MultiMask class based on MultiFab to replace the implementation
based map of Fabs.

* Make
** Add -Mbounds for PGI in debug mode
** Set up VPATH_LOCATIONS and INCLUDE_LOCATIONS in various Make.package and add vpath
to Make.rules so that the user does not need to do it.
