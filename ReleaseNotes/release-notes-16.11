        Release Notes for BoxLib 16.11

The development branch was merged into master on November 1, 2016.

* New Features
** Some AMR core functionalites have been moved into a new directory,
Src/C_AmrCoreLib, and part of the Amr class is now in a new class,
AmrCore.  This allows the user to write an Amr application without
using Amr, AmrLevel and StateData classes.  An example of this can be
found at Tutorials/AMR_Adv_C_v2/.
** New BaseFab::make_alias function that makes an alias to an existing BaseFab
with the component 0 pointing to a given component in the original
BaseFab.
** Add support for strings in ParmParse on Fortran side of C++ BoxLib based codes.
** New preprocessing approach for F90 files.
Int the new approach, cpp is used on the F90 file, a script is then
applied on the proprocessed file to figure out module dependency, and
finally the original F90 file is sent to the compiler for generating
.o files, which will also handle preprocessing.
** Particle can now template on container type, vector or deque.
** A new template parameter is add to support integer data.

* Backward Incompatible Changes
Particle now requires C++11.

* Other Changes
** Regression test script no longer requires probin file for C++ code.
** The times stored in StateData can now be synchronized with the level 0 time
in postCoarseTimeStep.
** Most of the Particle stuff is now in C_ParticleLib.
** Many functions in Particle have been moved into Nyx.
